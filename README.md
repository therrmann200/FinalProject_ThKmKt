### Project Proposal

#### Overview

We will visualize changes in snow depth over time and how it correlates with wildfire occurrences. The objectives are to show how snow depth impacts wildfire occurrence, size, and intensity. The significance of this relationship is that wildfires are becoming more frequent and more intense and snow packs are decreasing with each year. The visual representation of this relationship will be accessible to the public with the intention of raising awareness.
