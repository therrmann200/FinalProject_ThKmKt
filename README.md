#### Overview

We will visualize changes to NDVI over time within the boundaries of wildfires in Colorado. The objectives are to show how fire impacts the NDVI, and how quickly the NDVI can recover after a fire. The significance of this relationship is that wildfires are becoming more frequent and more intense and moving into areas where people live and recreate. The visual representation of this relationship will be accessible to the public with the intention of raising awareness, as well as better informing the public on potential recovery times from wildfires.
